# stocks_shiny
Using the Shiny package I constructed the web application in which a person would have various predictors (financial ratios) to choose from when wanting to make a price prediction for their selected stock. Stock price is the response (dependent) variable in this appliction. The time variable Date should always be checked as a variable during each analysis if you want to be able to make a prediction at some future date in time. The following explanatory variables are up to the user to select:

Predictors

Return on Assets
Return on Equity
Profit Margin
Current Ratio
Quick Ratio
Debt to Euity Ratio
Tnterest Coverage Ratio
Asset Turnover Ratio
Inventory Turnover Ratio
Date (should always be checked)
